This addon provides a helper for changing the title of the page you're on.

### Installing via ember-cli

`ember-page-title` follows the release format provided in [The Ember 2.x Project](http://emberjs.com/blog/2015/06/16/ember-project-at-2-0.html). For support of Ember versions below 1.13, please use `1.1.11` (named as `ember-document-title`):

```bash
ember install ember-document-title@1.1.11
```

For any other app, follow the scheme outlined in the blog post. Previous versions of the addon may work with newer versions of Ember, but that **is not guaranteed**-- YMMV. If you're on the latest stable release of Ember, you may install the addon without a version number.

```bash
ember install ember-page-title
```

#### Post Install Cleanup

As of v3.0.0 this addon maintains the page title by using the `<title>` tag in your document's `<head>`.  This is necessary for [FastBoot](https://github.com/tildeio/ember-cli-fastboot) compatibility.

Non-fastboot apps should keep the `<title>` tag in your index.html to ensure that the initial page served is valid HTML. The title will be replaced when your app boots.

Fastboot apps MUST remove the `<title>` tag from index.html.

### Digging in

[Visit the Docs site](http://tim-evans.github.io/ember-page-title/)

### Fastboot

When working with other addons that use `ember-cli-head`, you'll need to create a custom `head.hbs` file that exposes the `<title>` tag properly:

```hbs
<title>{{model.title}}</title>
```

This file is added automatically if you use `ember install`. This is for all the folks using ember-cli-head addons like ember-cli-meta-tags.

### API

| attribute | type    | default |
|-----------|:--------|:--------|
| separator | string  | `" | "` |
| prepend   | boolean | false   |
| replace   | boolean | false   |

These defaults are configurable in `config/environment.js`:

```javascript
// config/environment.js
/* jshint node: true */

module.exports = function(environment) {
  var ENV = {
    pageTitle: {
      replace: true
    }
  };

  return ENV;
};
```
